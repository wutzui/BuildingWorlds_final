**Description**
The room is build to create a sense of tangible reality. We created a room just like our general perception, however, there are only a few things that you could control. Just like the real world, sometimes we feel so small and powerless when it comes to a new place or an unfamiliar experience. The goal of this project is for players to find their strength to control the things they experience.  The mechanism is that players have to find the objects in the room that are clickable and keep trying when reaching the goal to win the starts. Overall, this is a puzzle game, the player needs to figure out how to win 3 points to win this game.

**Process**
We started to build our project before Thanksgiving from doing the 3d modeling for the room. We have built a bunch of furniture that is we decided to activate with the interactions to the game, such as the vintage TV set that contains antennas and tuning constraints, turntable disc player, and clocks that control the time that shows as the factor to the sunlight. Then we started working on the C# codes that control the interactions to each object. We learned how to use “OnMouseUpAsButton” function to control the objects. The most tricky one is to make the TV’s antenna clicked to activate the constraint and add a switch to change the channels based on each turn.

**Concept**
The project concept that we had before was very ambitious that probably beyond our capabilities to build for this final. We wanted to make a two spaces/dimensions simulation. Objects are randomly placed in two virtual screens but remain some similar orders, which two players need to collaborate to find out the difference between two similar spaces and try to adjust them in the same place or angle or some color. The goal of this game is to sync those two virtual spaces. When the two dimensions completely reach in the same condition, they will merge into one. And the 2 players will successfully meet each other. The concept behind of this game is that only the people see the world with similar perspectives and viewpoints can communicate with each other. For making two players could see each other and live in same space in this game, they should talk to each other to make the two spaces totally same.

However, we realized that this idea is somehow difficult for us to build, we haven’t time to work out two spaces to allow two players to play at same time. We minimize the scale of the concept and made it into one room only for one player for now. Like us mentioned in the beginning, the player needs to figure out how to make all the objects status and position in this game space are correct. 

For the next sept, we will try to work out two game spaces to allow two players work together. We think it might be more deliverable for our initial ideas.
